        <p>Sometimes people have a hard time getting out of bed. By using Habit Tracking, people will be more compelled to complete their daily habits. We will create an app that requires you to keep a streak of a habit. Habit Streaks, like streaks in Snapchat or streaks in Duolingo, will influence people to maintain a habit they care about. This is a struggle in people’s lives because getting motivation to complete a task can be really difficult, and planning habits take a lot of initiative. However, if you deliberately make a plan to do a task, and you are in a sense rewarded for it by incrementing your Daily Streak, you will be more compelled to maintain that habit.</p>
        <p>An information (or information technology) related issue within the context of the topic we are addressing is ensuring that users are dedicated to their streaks. Our app will only benefit users’ habits if they can continue the behavior for extended periods, so retention is an issue we have to tackle. In an article by the Harvard Business Review, researchers have found that the gamification of information makes it more digestible and easier to comprehend. We aim to include this feature by creating a “streak” style tracker for users to know how long they have been doing whatever it is they need to do. We acknowledge that this feature has already been implemented across a variety of other platforms, which is why we are hoping it will feel familiar to our users. In terms of other features, we may choose to implement other reminder notifications to address this problem.</p>
        <p>Many attempts to solve this problem in the past have been physical items to purchase, like journals or e-downloads to make markings in and track personal progress. There are many apps as well to address the topic of motivation within users, however, we aim to develop something a bit different, providing a new outlook on the issue. One of the top apps that shows up when searching for habit-tracking app on the app store/google is one called Habitify. (https://www.habitify.me/) This app as well as many like it tend to follow a more reminder-style interface where users create a reminder for the habit they want to develop and the app will send out notifications at the time intervals they specify. We want to create a more hands-on approach where the user checks in with the app more often to reinforce positive behavior.</p>

            <h3>User Interactions</h3>
            <!-- user interactions -->
            <p>We intend for the users of this app to be the general population. We specified the app to be a Husky-related app which means an audience of generally younger people, 18-22 years old, however, the app should be open to everyone. We imagine that a younger demographic would be the ones to embrace the app’s premise, as it may already be a familiar concept in their minds. As for its impact on minorities, the app should work the same for anyone who registers with it. Users format the app in the way they see the best fit, which may have minor differences from person to person, but overall open to everyone.</p>
            <p>The users will use the web app to track whether they have done their daily tasks. They will first <strong>create/schedule & upload a daily task</strong>. Then they will go to this app on a daily basis to <strong>click the button that says “Complete Task”</strong> once they have completed their daily task. The next day, they will click the button again, indicating that they have completed the task for that next day. This will ideally continue indefinitely, or until the user forgets to complete their task on a given day. Before all this, users will <strong>Log In</strong> to the app so they can access their habits (and possibly get a valid session token/cookie thing). </p>
